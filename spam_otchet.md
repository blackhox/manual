To send the validator to jail, I used a script that forwarded the token from one of my addresses to another, which led to a lot of spam transactions, in the Memo field of transactions, I indicated my moniker. Here is a link to a block explorer that shows spam transactions with my moniker:

Validator nodes that used servers with missing resources would start skipping blocks in this situation, which eventually led to them leaving the active set and putting the node in jail.
As a confirmation, I removed the "Khandyga" moniker validator from the active set: https://explorer.stavr.tech/haqq/staking/haqqvaloper138s62phmfks30ph84fjylncg0hpcsfz94kdtem

In addition, I can provide screenshots with the steps to disable this validator
